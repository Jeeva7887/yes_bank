        "The objective of this study is to forecast stock closing prices using regression models, specifically Linear Regression (OLS), Ridge Regression, and Random Forest. Here's a summary of the regression project:\n",
        "\n",
        "   1:Data Preprocessing: The dataset underwent cleaning procedures to address missing values, duplicates, and outliers. Standardization and normalization techniques were applied to ensure data consistency.\n",
        "\n",
        "   2:Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): During this phase, the data was visualized and analyzed to extract insights. Cleaning and preprocessing steps, such as handling missing values, duplicates, and outliers, were performed. Data visualization techniques were employed to identify patterns and trends.\n",
        "\n",
        "   3:Feature Engineering: New features like Year, Month, and Quarter were engineered to capture temporal patterns and enhance model accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "   4:Splitting: The dataset was split into training and testing sets to facilitate model implementation. The training set was used to train the models, while the testing set was utilized for evaluation.\n",
        "\n",
        "   5:Model Implementation: Regression models, including Linear Regression (OLS), Ridge Regression, and Random Forest, were implemented to predict stock prices. Model performance was evaluated using metrics like mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared. Cross-validation techniques were utilized to assess model performance on unseen data. The best-performing model was selected for production deployment based on comprehensive evaluation.\n",
        "\n",
        "   6:Model Explainability: Models were analyzed to interpret the factors influencing stock price predictions. Techniques like Permutation Importance Scores were used to assess feature importance and elucidate the relationship between features and predicted values.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, this project successfully utilized Linear Regression (OLS), Ridge Regression, and Random Forest for stock price prediction, encompassing data preprocessing, feature engineering, model implementation, and explainability analysis. The best-performing model as Linear regression(OLS) was selected based on comprehensive evaluation, achieving the project's objectives."

Against this backdrop, it is compelling to examine the impact of this incident on the bank's stock prices and assess the effectiveness of time series or other predictive models in capturing such intricate scenarios. The dataset under consideration spans monthly stock prices of Yes Bank from its inception, providing information on monthly closing, opening, highest, and lowest stock prices."
